# Opening tutorial

Before doing your first bid, start by counting your points to evaluate the strength of your hand. Bidding is used to assess the number of points you and your partner have, and assess the contract type: No trump or at the color, and how many tricks the team can get. A slam is all 13 tricks. 
  
When you get your hand count the honor points, assess the card distribution, add distribution points if the hand is unregular, bid to open the bidding phase.

## Count the honor points

 | Card | H |
 | --- | --- |  
 | As | 4 H |  
 | King | 3 H |  
 | Queen | 2 H |  
 | Jack | 1 H |  

## Assess the card distribution

### Regular hand
The distribution is one of {4,4,3,2} or { 4,3,3,3} or { 5, 3, 3, 2}

### Irregular Hand
The rest.

For irregular hand, count the number of cards in each color, and adds up the distribution points

 | Number of Cards | D |
 | --- | --- |  
 | No card | 3 D |  
 | One card | 2 D |  
 | Two cards | 1 D |  
 | 6th card  | 1 D |  

> Points DH = points H + points D

## Open at level 1 from 12H or 14DH to 23DH

If not Pass.
